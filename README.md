# The Project
Depart Aware is a design prototype built to visualize filtered data retrieved from flight API's to accurately display arrival/departure times and gate changes based on chosen gates at the specific airport.


# The Scope of the Prototype
The scope of this prototype is limited to Southwest Airlines departing from Las Vegas. Data is updated from flight API's at specified thresholds based on the flights current status.


# Technologies Used
- The web app is designed to function as an SPA utilizing ReactJS.
- The dedicated API is designed as a REST API running on ExpressJS with MySql as the database.


# Demo

# Running Your Own Prototype
The current prototype utilizes the AeroAPI and soon Cirius. I am currently looking into adding Rate Limiting to the HTTP Service Handler to be functional with the Free Base AeroAPI Subscription. Cirius API has not yet been integrated but will require an approved application to utilize the API if integrated.


# The Future of the Prototype
This prototype was designed to cater a specific industry and whether or not the project will continue is unknown.
